# Medusa-Toolhead

Toolhead designed for the SnakeOil-XY CoreXY 3D Printer [Github](https://github.com/ChipCE/SnakeOil-XY).

Designed to need the least hardware as possible while still being stiff and light.

Belt mounting on the toolhead itself is very simplified to save weigth. You will need to print the tensioning front idlers to adjust the tension in the belts.

Uses a modified [Eva](https://github.com/EVA-3D/eva-main) cooling duct.

Currently supports:
	- Dragon SF and HF
	- Mosquito or NF-Crazy
	- Rapido
	
Requires: 
	- 3010 Fan for hotend cooling.
	- 5015 Fan for part cooling
